# AI Powered Mock Test Platform for JEE and NEET

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an end-to-end **AI-Powered Assessment Platform** that simulates real **Computer-Based Test (CBT)** environments for **JEE and NEET** exams. The platform is designed with a focus on adaptability, scalability, and AI-driven personalization. It supports:

- **Dynamic and adaptive test generation**
- **Flexible test selection modules for chapter-wise, subject-wise, and full-syllabus exams**
- **Real-time analytics dashboard for subject-wise accuracy insights and performance tracking**
- **Detailed test review with answer explanations**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for personalized remedial practice**
  

## High-Level Workflow

1. User logs in or signs up
2. Selects stream → subject → test type
3. Starts the test in a CBT-style interface
4. Completes the test and submits answers
5. Backend evaluates the test and stores results
6. Analytics dashboard displays performance insights
7. Weak areas are identified → RAG engine generates remedial questions
8. Next test includes personalized remedial items based on performance
